# Overview

This is an application that allows users to register, login, and send stickers to other users. The
users can see the stickers they have sent to other users as well as the stickers they have received
from other users.

# What I have learned

1. How to use Google's Firebase Realtime Database to store data and configure listeners when the
   data change.
2. How to use Google's Cloud Messaging to send notifications to specific users.

# My contribution to the project

1. Set up Firebase Realtime Database and created code for communication betweeen the app and the
   database.
2. Helped with Cloud Messaging to send notifications to users.
